### Command line tool for Denial of Service Attacks

![experimental](ship.jpg)

I don't know how many times **I've written**, **rewritten** this code but in the end I hope it will be fine. So my main idea is to write a friendly command line **Dos**(*Denial of service*) tool. This tool can be used to test many things like : 

- internet connections 
- traffic flow on custom interfaces 
- stress test 
- system vulnerabilities 
- traffic monitoring 
- webserver performance testing 
- etc. 

This tool should be used just for educational purpose but I don't care(in the end) what you do with the code. I hope this will be a fine experience for me as a C developer and hope other guys in the future will contribute on this project to make it much cooler. Short story , the commit(at least 100 so) log is really **polluted** because at first I wanted to create a library to abstract all of the things and after I had written the final tool but, that was just a wrong approach. 

 > So I have in mind some things that I want to support at first so I will update **the list** as  time goes by. 

There are many types of **Denial of service** methods in the wild and I will list all of them to make a good overview.


## Types of attacks

- Connection Oriented (**this tool will address this**)
- Application Oriented
